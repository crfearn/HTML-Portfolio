    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my Online Resume</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Charles and I'm a senior computer
        science student. I'm currently trying to learn web 
        development.Throughout my process, I will continue 
        to update This site with new skills and techniques 
        that I learn. Some things like photos and/or sections
        of text may be filled with a placeholder for a bit 
        while I'm working on the site. I might keep elements
        as they are so I can see the progress that I'm making
         but we'll see. Have a good one!
